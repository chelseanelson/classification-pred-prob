## Classification Prediction Problem - Figures 

### Documents 

`figure-1.png` : figure showcasing the distribution of the response variable (`host_is_superhost`)

### Folders

`univariate/` : contains files of figures related to my univariate analysis.

`bivariate/` : contains files of figures related to my bivariate analysis.

## Acknowledgement 

Most of the figures generated during the analysis are in PNG format. 
You can explore them separately or follow the order of my analysis by 
starting with Figure 1 in the univariate directory and progressing 
through subsequent figures.
