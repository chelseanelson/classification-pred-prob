## Classification Prediction Problem

Welcome to my classification prediction problem repository! This project is dedicated to addressing the prediction problem of superhost status using a comprehensive dataset of airbnb booking data. Through rigorous analysis and model development, we have identified key insights and culminated in selecting a Random Forest model and Boosted Tree model as our top performers, achieving impressive `roc_auc` values of .934 and .954, respectively. Thus delving into the intricacies of predictive modeling in the rental home business, striving to contribute valuable insights to the field.
